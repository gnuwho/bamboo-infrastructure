Usage
-----

*You must have [terraform](https://terraform.io/) installed the `terraform`
command in your path.*

```
terraform apply -var 'access_key=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}' -var 'secret_key=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}'
```

`${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}` and `${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}` above represent environment
variables that hold credentials for the `bamboo-ci` AWS user

In order to login via ssh, you must have the bamboo-ci keypair credentials and
then issue this command:

```
ssh -i bamboo-ci.pem ubuntu@`cat public_ip.txt`
```
